===============================================================================
==                How to 	Build SoftSensorManager                          ==
===============================================================================

Once the source code is downloaded in your local specific folder, you may follow 
the steps to build and execute Soft Sensor Manager and its applications. 
In this context, we assume that the code was downloaded into 'oic' folder.


=======================================
1. Download source code
=======================================

Once you download the codes, please make sure that the downloaded code structure is as follows; 

oic/resource 
oic/service
oic/utilities
 
 
The path for Soft Sensor Manager is as following;

oic/service/soft-sensor-manager
 
The SoftSensorManager directory includes following sub directories;

Directories	Description
oic/service/soft-sensor-manager/build            : There are makefiles for different platform; Linux, Tizen, and Arduino.  
oic/service/soft-sensor-manager/doc              : SSM developer's guide and Getting started documents
oic/service/soft-sensor-manager/SampleApp        : There are two types of sample applications; application for UI, and application for physical sensors.
                                                   For UI application, there are SSMTesterApp in /linux, and /Tizen.
                                                   For physical sensors, 
                                                        1) Temperature and Humidity sensors, THSensorApp, in \linux and \arduino.
                                                           In the two directories, in \linux and \arduino , there are two TemperaterHumiditySensor applications, 
                                                           THSensorApp and THSensorApp1, and they are for DiscomfortSoftSensor which aggregates 
                                                           two TemperaterHumiditySensors to calculate current discomfort index in the given room.
                                                        2) Trackee_Thing for IndoorTrajectorySensor in \linux and \arduino
 
oic/service/soft-sensor-manager/SDK              : The SDK APIs for applications is located.
oic/service/soft-sensor-manager/SSMCore          : The SSM service codes 
oic/service/soft-sensor-manager/SoftSensorPlugin : The source codes for soft sensors can be located in this folder. 
                                                       Examples of soft sensors are DiscomfortIndexSensor and IndoorTrajectorySensor.


=======================================
2. Refer readme files in each build 
   directory for each module.
=======================================
There are readme files in the build directories for each module (e.g. \SDK, \ SSMCore,  \SampleApp). 
Please refer the files for specific setup.


=======================================
3. Run make
=======================================

3.1 Run make for SoftSensorManager & App in Ubuntu. 

3.1.1 Before running make for SoftSensorManager & App in Ubuntu, resource should be built in advance.
